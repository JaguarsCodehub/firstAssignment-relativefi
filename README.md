This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project assignment bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## This Assignment is built using Typescript, Tailwind Css and Next Js 🔥⚡⚡⚡

I have focused more on the design and ui part of this project, about the elements, the clarity of the images and the spacings too.

## Getting Started
First clone this project using ```git clone (the url)```

Next install all the dependencies using ```npm install```

First, run the development server: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
